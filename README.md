1️⃣ Problem Understanding & Research (10 Marks)
🔍 Real-World Context

Rocket launches are governed by fundamental physics principles. A rocket moves upward due to thrust, while gravity pulls it downward. As fuel burns, the rocket becomes lighter, which changes acceleration dynamically over time.

Key forces involved:

Thrust (T) – Upward engine force

Gravity (mg) – Downward force

Mass (m) – Changes as fuel burns

Understanding these relationships is essential for aerospace engineers when designing efficient and successful missions.

🧠 Research Insights

Guiding questions explored:

How does increasing payload affect required fuel?

Does higher mission cost increase mission success?

How does thrust-to-mass ratio impact altitude?

Can simulated physics results align with real historical mission data?

The project integrates mathematical modeling with historical space mission data to answer these questions interactively.

Project Summary – Rocket Launch Path Visualization 

This project presents an interactive Streamlit web application designed to analyze and simulate rocket launch missions using real-world mission data and mathematical modeling.

The application integrates Newton’s Second Law to simulate rocket motion dynamically. By calculating acceleration as a function of thrust and gravitational force and updating velocity and altitude over discrete time steps, the simulation models realistic launch behavior. Fuel mass reduction dynamically alters total mass, affecting acceleration over time.

Data preprocessing was performed using pandas, including type conversions, missing value handling, and structured filtering. Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted through five required visualizations: scatter plot, bar chart, line chart, box plot, and success comparison plot.

Key findings include:

Positive correlation between payload weight and fuel consumption.

Higher mission cost does not necessarily result in higher success.

Launch vehicle selection influences mission cost efficiency.

Thrust-to-mass ratio significantly impacts launch altitude.

The final application was deployed successfully on Streamlit Cloud, and the GitHub repository contains organized code, documentation, and deployment details.

This project demonstrates the practical integration of mathematical modeling, statistical reasoning, Python programming, and interactive data visualization in solving real-world aerospace problems.
